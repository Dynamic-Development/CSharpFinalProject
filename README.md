# C# Final Project
> For our C# project, we decided to create a game called __Space Mafia__. It is a 2D top down shooter game that uses SDL2 as our graphic engine. All visuals were done custom through use of an online sprite-creation program called PISKEL. Piskel turns drawn images into png files, spritesheets, or even gifs.
