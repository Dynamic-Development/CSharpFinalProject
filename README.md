# C# Final Project
> For our C# project, we decided to create a game called __Space Mafia__. It is a 2D top down shooter game that uses SDL2 as our graphic engine. SDL2 is a higher level OpenGL framework usable in C#, C++, and C. SDL takes advantage of all of the computer's inputs from mouse and keyboard, or joysticks and throttle flight controllers, and allows those inputs to run various segments of the written code. All visuals were done custom through use of an online sprite-creation program called PISKEL. Piskel turns drawn images into png files, spritesheets, or even gifs, which we used to create every single texture on screen at any given time. 

## Install Instructions
